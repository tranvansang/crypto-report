\chapter{Damm's method}

Damm's method is check digit algorithm based on 
\emph{quasigroup}.
It can detect all single-digit errors and all adjacent transposition errors.

\section{Quasigroup}

\emph{Quasigroup} $(Q,*)$ is a set $Q$ with a binary operation ``$*$''
such that  \emph{ Latin square property} holds:
for every $a,b \in Q$, there exists unique $x$ and $y$ satisfy the following.
\begin{align*}
 a*x = b\\
 y*a = b
\end{align*}

Let us consider a \emph{Cayley table} of the operation ``$*$''.
Latin square property can be characterize by whether 
the table is \emph{Latin square}:
each element occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.
For example, the operation expressed by the following table
satisfies Latin square property.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l || l | l | l |}
\hline
$*$& 0 & 1 & 2\\
\hline\hline
0   & 0 & 1 & 2\\
\hline
1   & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
\hline
1   & 2 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}

The following lemma is derived immediately,
which is significant for error detection  of 
damm's method.
\begin{lemma}
 Suppose $(Q,*)$ is quasigroup.
 For arbitrary $x,x'$ and $a$ in $Q$, the following hold.
\begin{align*}
 x \neq x'\; \rightarrow a*x \neq a*x' \\
 x \neq x'\; \rightarrow x*a \neq x'*a
 \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
