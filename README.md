# Cryptography report

- Topic: Checksum We presented basic checksum algorithms such as the one used in credit card numbers. Explain what is a quasigroup. Present and analyze Damm’s method based on quasigroups to detect all single-digit and transposition errors. Are there other quasigroups that work ?

    Requirement: 5 to 10 pages

    Deadline: before June 11, 2018
